# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Detection | Machine Learning Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on voice data for early detection of Parkinson's disease and utilizes machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for classification. This project is currently in development and is not yet complete.

## 📚 Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be accessed from the following link:
- [Parkinson's Disease Dataset Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/parkinsons-disease-dataset-analysis)

This dataset contains biomedical voice measurements and corresponding Parkinson's disease diagnoses.
